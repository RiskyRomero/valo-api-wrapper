# VALO API WRAPPER

Valo API Wrapper is fork of tanishqmanuja's [valorant-api-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tqman/valorant-api-client), this package is meant to extend it's available endpoints for Valorant. I hope to cover all known endpoints provided by [valorant-api-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/valorant-api-types) while also providing ease of use access for developers.
